## Overview

Raycast is highly polished, and I'm annoyed with Spotlight (why would I ever want to search the internet for "bluetooth"
from Spotlight instead of open the Bluetooth settings?). There are a few repeated actions I take every day that should
work nicely from Raycast, and I want to explore how to implement these using Raycast's extensions.

Update: After some more experience with Raycast, wow I can't believe how polished this is. Install/uninstall for extensions
is a breeze. The speed of completions is perfect. Overall, it seems like thoughtful design thinking has saturated all
facets of it. Really cool. 


## Standalone subprojects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone subprojects. Each subproject is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone subproject constraint_
forces the subprojects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The subprojects include:


## `bookmark-opener/`

This is a "hello world"-style Raycast extension that opens a bookmark in your web browser.

See the README in [bookmark-opener/](bookmark-opener/).


## Wish List

General clean-ups, todos and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [x] DONE Build a "hello world"-style extension. I'm going to make a bookmark opener.
* [ ] Extension that launches my GitHub repositories. How would this work exactly?
